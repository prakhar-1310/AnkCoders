Project Proposal: Numerology Analysis
Software
1. Introduction
This document outlines the design, functionality, and implementation plan for a Numerology
Analysis Software. The application will provide users with detailed numerological insights
based on their name and date of birth, supporting the Pythagorean and Chaldean systems of
numerology.
2. Objectives
● Develop a software system that computes core numerological numbers.
● Provide personal year, month, and day cycles for users.
● Enable name analysis, including vowel and consonant breakdowns.
● Allow generation of personalized numerology reports.
● Ensure an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
3. Scope
The software will include:
● Calculation of Life Path, Expression, Soul Urge, Personality, Birthday, and Maturity
numbers.
● Personal cycles (Year, Month, Day).
● Name breakdown with numerical mapping.
● Compatibility analysis between two individuals.
● PDF report export.
Future expansions will support:
● Multiple languages.
● Non-Latin script handling through transliteration.
● Premium subscription features.
4. Numerology Systems
4.1 Pythagorean
Mapping of alphabets A–Z to numbers 1–9.
4.2 Chaldean
Mapping of alphabets with traditional rules (1–8, sometimes omitting 9).
5. Core Calculations
● Life Path: Derived from date of birth.
● Expression Number: Based on full name.
● Soul Urge Number: Derived from vowels in name.
● Personality Number: Derived from consonants in name.
● Maturity Number: Combination of Life Path and Expression.
● Personal Cycles: Year, month, and day based on DOB and current date.
6. System Design
6.1 Input
● Full name (birth certificate name).
● Current name (optional).
● Date of birth (YYYY-MM-DD).
● System choice: Pythagorean or Chaldean.
6.2 Output
● Computed numerological numbers with reduction paths.
● Letter breakdown with vowel/consonant distinction.
● Personal cycles.
● PDF report option.
7. Technical Architecture
● Backend: Python with FastAPI for computation and API.
● Frontend: React/Next.js for user interface.
● Database (optional): PostgreSQL for storing reports and user data.
● PDF Generation: Server-side tools like WeasyPrint.
8. Ethics & Compliance
● The software is for self-reflection and entertainment purposes only.
● Clear disclaimers will be provided.
● User data privacy and consent will be prioritized (GDPR/DPDP compliance).
9. Implementation Plan
Week 1: Core numerology module and testing.
Week 2: API development and basic frontend integration.
Week 3: Personal cycles, letter breakdown, and PDF export.
Week 4: Compatibility analysis, interpretation content, and UI polish.
10. Conclusion
This Numerology Analysis Software will combine ancient numerological principles with modern
technology to provide users with meaningful insights in a structured, user-friendly way. Its
modular design will allow for easy future expansion and customization.
